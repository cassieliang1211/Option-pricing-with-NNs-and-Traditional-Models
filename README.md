## Abstract
Option pricing, a critical component of financial derivatives valuation, has traditionally relied on models like Black-Scholes for European options and the Binomial tree for American options. However, the complexities of modern financial markets, especially over extended durations, reveal certain limitations in these models. This study delves into a comparative analysis of traditional models against emerging neural network models, specifically Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, using European (S&P 500) and American (Alphabet) options as test cases. Our results underscore the consistent superiority of RNNs in capturing intricate pricing dynamics, while LSTMs displayed promising results in short to mid-term scenarios but faced challenges in specific long-term applications. The traditional models, though foundational, displayed diminishing accuracy in certain contexts. Considering these findings, this study ardently advocates for a broader embrace of neural network models in the option pricing domain, suggesting a promising synergy between computational advancements and financial modeling. By championing the integration of these neural models, the research endeavors to pave the way for more accurate and adaptive option valuation methodologies in evolving financial landscapes.
